      "Once upon a time, a brother and sister named Hansel and Gretel lived in a hut in the woods with their father who was a poor woodcutter and their mother. Their parents were very poor and had barely enough food to eat One day, their parents sent them off into the woods in search of greener pastures. Their mother cried as she sent them off but they could not take care of them any longer. Hansel and Gretel took a few pebbles and some bread crumbs with them. That night the two children had nowhere to sleep. They wandered in the forest for days, looking for food and a place to stay. The children slept under a tree that night and kept each other warm. The next morning when the sun rose, Hansel turned to his little sister. â€śGretel,â€ť he said, â€śwe cannot stay here.  We must go deeper into the woods!  Surely we will find more to eat than what we get at home and we can bring some food for mother and fatherâ€ť Gretel was worried. â€śBut what if we get lost?â€ť she asked â€śWe wonâ€™t!â€ť said Hansel.  â€śIf we get lost, we will follow the pebbles back home.â€ť As they went deeper and deeper into the forest, the children decided to drop pebbles on the path to help them find a way back home if they get lost. Soon, they had no more pebbles and all they had left were bread crumbs.  Gretel was careful to drop one crumb and then after a bit, another. There was no luck and the children had looked and looked for any sign of something to eat â€“ an apple tree, pear tree, some nuts on the ground, or even dried-up berries.  There was nothing to eat!  They got hungrier and hungrier and the children were tired. They decided to go back home or they would starve. They turned back and all the bread crumbs were gone. Now they were lost! They did not know their way back home. â€śOh, no!â€ť cried Gretel â€śThe birds ate up all the crumbs!â€ť the children were sad. Gretel began to cry but Hansel assured her they will be safe. They walked on and suddenly, a wolf howled in the distance. They hurried away to avoid being eaten by the wolf. The sun was setting and the children were lost and hungry.  Now they were scared, too. Soon, they saw a strange house made up of cookies, candies, and chocolates. The children were immediately happy and ran along the path to the house. They knocked at the yummy chocolate door but nobody answered. They knocked again and the door opened. The children were too hungry to wait for the owner of the house. They went in and started to eat the yummy door. When they both were eating the yummy door, a witch pounced on them. The strange house belonged to a witch! The children begged for their lives but the evil witch did not listen. She locked up Hansel in a cage and asked Gretel to help her heat the oven. She would cook them and eat them up. But just as the witch bent to check the ovenâ€™s temperature, Gretel pushed her from behind and locked the oven door. Gretel rescued Hansel and they filled their pockets with the witchâ€™s jewels and goodies. They ran as fast as they could through the forest without stopping. They were too scared to stop for the witch may catch up to them. Finally, they managed to find their way back home and gave jewels to their parents. Thanks to the clever children! The family was never poor and hungry again.\n",

      "Once upon a time, there was a farmer with three little pigs. He did not have enough food to take care of his pigs so he sent them away to take care of themselves. The first little pig was walking on the road. Suddenly he saw a man with some straws. He could  build a house with the straws, he said to himself and asked the man to give him his straws. The man was kind so he gave the first little pig his straws. The pig used the straws to build a straw house and danced around. Suddenly, a big bad wolf knocked on the door. â€śLittle pig, little pig, let me come in.â€ť The big bad wolf said â€śNo! Go away big bad wolfâ€ť, the little pig said â€śThen Iâ€™ll puff, and Iâ€™ll huff, and Iâ€™ll blow your house in.â€ś, the big bad wolf said So he huffed, and puffed, and he blew the house down. The big bad wolf ate up the little pig. The second little pig saw a man with some mud. He coud build a house with the mud, he said to himself and asked the man to give him his mud. The man was also kind so he gave the second little pig his mud. The pig used the mud to build a mud house and danced around. Suddenly, a big bad wolf knocked on the door. â€śLittle pig, little pig, let me come in.â€ť The big bad wolf said â€śNo! Go away big bad wolfâ€ť, the little pig said â€śThen Iâ€™ll puff, and Iâ€™ll huff, and Iâ€™ll blow your house in.â€ś, the big bad wolf said So he huffed, and puffed, and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed once more then he blew the house down. The big bad wolf ate up the second little pig. The third little pig saw a man with some red bricks. He could build a house with the red bricks, he said to himself and asked the man to give him his red bricks. The man was kind too so he gave the third little pig his straws. The pig used the straws to build a straw house and danced around. Suddenly, a big bad wolf knocked on the door. â€śLittle pig, little pig, let me come in.â€ť The big bad wolf said â€śNo! Go away big bad wolfâ€ť, the little pig said â€śThen Iâ€™ll puff, and Iâ€™ll huff, and Iâ€™ll blow your house in.â€ś, the big bad wolf said So he huffed, and puffed, and huffed and puffed, and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed once more but he could not blow down the house. The red brick was very strong. The third little pig was very happy that the wolf could not blow down his house. The wolf was very angry. He had a new plan. He will trick the little pig so that it will step out of the house and he will eat the little pig. â€śLittle pig, I know where there are nice applesâ€ť â€śWhere?â€ť asked the little pig. â€śThey are in the fields up the hill. If you will, we will go together tomorrow and get some for dinner.â€ť â€śOkay,â€ť said the little pig, â€śI will be ready. What time are we going?â€ť, asked the little pig. â€śAt six oâ€clockâ€ť, said the big bad wolf. The next day, the pig woke up very early and went to fetch the apples before the big bad wolf arrived. â€śLittle pig, are you ready?â€ť, the big bad wolf asked.  I have gone and come back, and got a nice potful for dinner.â€ť, said the little pig. The wolf felt very angry at this. The little pig was very smart. He decided to climb up the chimney but the little pig was very smart indeed. He placed a big pot of boiling water at the bottom of the chimney. When the big bad wolf climbed down, he fell into the pot of boiling water. The little pig cheered. Now, the  big bad wolf was no more.\n"
