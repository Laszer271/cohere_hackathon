      "Story title: Two Little Pigs That Tried To Learn Programming\n",
      " Once upon a time, there was a programmer who had two little pigs who wanted to learn programming\n",
      ".  The programmer wanted to teach them how to program, but had no time to do so, so the programmer had to go to work.  Before leaving, the programmer told the two little pigs to go to a computer and type.  The two little pigs did not know how to type, so they got scared and hid in a corner.  A few hours later, the programmer came home, saw that the two little pigs did not go to the computer, and went to the computer to see why the two little pigs did not go to the computer.  The programmer then saw that the two little pigs did not go to the computer because they did not know how to type, so the programmer taught them how to type.  The next day, the programmer left the two little pigs again and told them to type.  The two little pigs were afraid, so they ran to the computer, typed, and compiled their code.  The two little pigs' code compiled successfully and then, the two little pigs ran around the house screaming happily.\n",
