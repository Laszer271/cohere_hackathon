One day when Daisy was out riding her horse, she came across an old dragon who was stuck in mud up to his neck! (...) \"I am afraid I can't help you,\" said Daisy bravely \"because I don't have any money.\" \"Well,\" said the dragon after thinking for a while, \"If you want to get me out of this muck, you'll have to kiss me!\" (...) So Daisy gave him a big smooch on his snout and the dragon squirmed and slithered until he popped out of the mud! (...) \"Why don't you come home with me?\" asked Daisy sweetly. But when they got back to the castle, it turned out that being a princess wasn't all that bad after all! (...) Everyone thought it was very romantic when they saw them together at dinner that night! It turned out that this wasn't just any dragon; he was actually Prince Charming! And even though he didn't look like much with all those scales covering up his face, underneath them he was as handsome as could be! (...) So now instead of hating her life as princess, Daisy loved it! And now everyone knows how important good manners are\n"

But thanks to this fearless princess and brave dragon everyone lived happily ever after! Thank goodness those two heroes were there when we needed them most! \n",
